> Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later , and is is often argued that these the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime . To what extent do you agree or disagree?

> :watermelon: Example
>
> It is ture that ex-prisoners can become normal , productive members of society . I completely agree **with** the idea that allowing shch people to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to <u>discourage them from breaking the law</u>. 
>
> `In my opinion, teenagers <u>are more likely to</u> accept advice from some who can speak from experience` . Reformed offenders can tell young people about **how they became involved in crime , the dangers of a criminal lifestyle , and what life in prison is really like** . They can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives . While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people , I imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender . The vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to <u>have a powerful impact</u>
>
> `The alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective` . <u>One option would be</u> for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people . This could be useful <u>in term of</u> informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught , but young people are often relucant to take advice from figures of authority . <u>A second option would be</u> for **school teachers** to speak to their students about crime, but I doubt that students would see teachers as <u>credible sources</u> of information about this topic . **Finally** ,<u>educational films</u> might be informative , but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions .
>
> In conclusion , I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to <u>deter teenagers from committing crimes</u>. [震慑某人不要做。。]

> The issue of whether mass media should give detailed descriptions of crime is of great concern to the public . Some people claim that it exerts an adverse impact on individuals and society . Therefore , the media should be constrained in the details they report . Personally , I vote for this idea . 
>
> <u>Admittedly</u> , giving detailed descriptions of crime has many benefits . It can serve as a warning to potential criminals , which reduces the possibility of the occurrence of similar crimes . It also helos people to strengthen the awareness of crime-prevention by popularizing the protective actions against crime . <u>However</u> , the negative influences resulting from these detailed illustrations of crime should not be ignored.

> **To begin with**, victms who suffer from crime bear the brunt of those detailed description . Giving detailed demonstrations of crime , to some extend, forces those victims to experience the nightmare again . Consequently , It will lead them to be afflicted with chronic psychological problems ,such as anxiety , fear and depression . What it worse , some of them may commit suicide .

> <u>In addition</u> , those programs may give the public an illusion[疏远] that they are surrounded by a considerable number of would-be criminals . As a consequence , people may lose a sense of social security and find it difficult to trust others . Under this circumstance, the alienation of interpersonal relationships will ensue .

## Feb 13 ， 2020

###### :pen: How should I extend my answer

:o: Do you think that children do less sport and exercies than in the past

1. support your opinions + reason / example[your own example . make it up]  :point_left:

> Yes , I agree
>
> Children have more homework and are under more pressure at school than before . So they have less time to play sports or do something outside
>
> <u>For example, when I was younger</u> , I played outside with my friends every day after school . Nowadays I never see children playing outside . 

:watermelon: What if I can't think of any example from my own life ?  :strawberry: 编

> <u>For example</u> , `my nephew is 8 years old this year  . He has to do about two hours of homework everyday after school. Of course , it means he's too tired to go outside or do anything in the evening` 
>
> <u>For example</u> , **in a recent survey , researchers discovered that children 20 years ago didi 5 hours of exercies of physical activity every week . Now the average is just 2 hour a week ** . 

2. Speculate[猜测] : talk about possibilities   :point_left:

- You can talk about ideas and things you don't know about
- You don't have to always talk the fact
- Children definitely do less sports and exercies nowadays , but <u>I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it's because</u> they spend more time online , playing game or watch movies , things like that
- Or , parents may not be willing to let children play outside nowadays , especially in big cities , since there are many cars on the street . 

> It's possible that ...
>
> The other possible reason is that ..

- It's possible that there aren't so many parks and other places where children can play sports
- <u>The other possible reason is that</u> parents aren't interested in sport, so they don't encourage their kids to play and be active 

> If 
>
> Obviously , if ... 

- If children have more homework nowadays , of course it'll be more difficult for them to play sport
- Obviously , if children spend lots of time in front of a screen , they won't go outside and do something active . 

> I'm not sure why that is . Maybe it's because ...
>
> Or , it may ..
>
> It's possible that ..
>
> The other possible reason is that ...
>
> If ...
>
> Obviously , if ... 

3. Show the other side of the argument  :point_left:

- Some day do less sports , but others may not
- <u>On the one hand</u> , for example , many of my cousins are very active , often more active than their parents.
- <u>On the other hand</u> , children nowadays get more interested in new sports and activities easily by using the internet . Thanks to technology . 

:watermelon: Example

> Yes , I agree . Children have more homework and are under more pressure at school . So they have less to play sports or do something outside . For example , when I was younger , I played outside with my friends every day after achool. 
>
> Nowadays , I never see children playing outside . **I'm not sure why** that is . <u>Maybe it's because</u> they spend more time online , playing video games . 
>
> <u>However</u> , spending time online <u>could help</u> them to get more interested in new sports and activities easily . Thanks to technology. 

:o: What if I need time to think ? 

:o: Need time to make up a reason ? 

4. Use <u>filler phrases</u> - in the beginning :point_left: 

- Let me think about that for a second
- That's an interesting questions
- That's a little tricky question , I never thought about that
- Well , what can I say about that ?
- Let me think what else can I say ? 
- Let me see , can I think of another example ? 
- What other reasons could there be for this ？ 

5. Be honest if you really don't know what to say :point_left: 

- I really have no idea . 
- I don't have children , and none of my friends do either . 
- I'm afraid it's just a topic I can say much about .
